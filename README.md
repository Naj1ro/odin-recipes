# odin-recipes

Starting the project:

With this project, the goal is to set up a main website with links to other pages containing recipes. Additionally, this will help with getting familiar with the commiting process while working with Git and Github. Lastly, this project will serve as the foundation of a project with CSS in a future lesson.
