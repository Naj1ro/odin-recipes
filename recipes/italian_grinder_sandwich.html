        <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>The Italian grinder sandwich (called the Guinea grinder once-upon-a-time) is a comfort food classic. The satisfying, meaty creation combines minced onion and fresh basil with shakes of fennel seed and red pepper flakes for a sandwich we come back to over and over again.</p>
            <p>It's just one of many favorites folks have plucked from the fair's culinary pages. The Iowa State Fair began as an agriculture and livestock showcase in 1854, welcoming a dairy building, machinery hall, cattle barn, and the now legendary carnival and food vendor midway over the years. Iowa's single largest event has become synonymous with indulgent deep-fried foods on a stick.</p>
